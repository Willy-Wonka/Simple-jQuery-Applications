# Simple-jQuery-Applications
### September 2014
###### Lab projects (Web-based Information Systems course).
This repository includes two applications.  
The two applications used different approaches to implement the following:
  * After 'double click', a word is selected, and the menu of four colors is displayed a bit above.
  * The menu should appear slowly, i.e., 'fadeIn', not at once.
  * When a color is selected by clicking on the menu, the background color of the selected word is changed to the selected color.
  * The menu should disappear at once, not 'fadeOut'.

Objectives of the Application #:

```
2. Build a jQuery like library, called jsFun to modify the above highlight application

  * Closure function
```
